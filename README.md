DeciCollab is a short and impactful name that emphasizes both the decision-making process and the collaborative nature of the project. Here's how you could further position DeciCollab:

* __Core Focus__: DeciCollab is a platform or repository designed to streamline and document decisions made within a collaborative environment. Whether it's architectural choices, technical debt, or strategic product decisions, this repository serves as the central hub for all decision-related discussions.
* __Collaborative Element__: The name “Collab” points directly to the importance of inclusivity and communication across multiple teams. It implies an open, transparent process where all stakeholders—developers, product owners, architects, and other team members—have a voice in the decision-making.
* __Streamlining Decision Tracking__: By using DeciCollab, teams can document decisions through structured templates (such as ADRs and TDRs) that include the rationale behind decisions, trade-offs, and impacts. This helps everyone keep track of past decisions, especially for complex projects or systems.
__Optimized for Iteration__: The repo encourages frequent revisiting and updating of decisions as the project evolves, so it fits well in environments where constant adaptation and improvements are necessary.


Possible Features for the Repository:

* Templates for ADRs/TDRs: Structured formats for easy documentation of architectural and technical debt decisions.
* Discussion Forums/Threads: Integrated discussions for cross-team collaboration before decisions are finalized.
* Version Control for Decisions: Track changes over time in key decisions, showing what was revised and why.
* Cross-Team Collaboration: Mechanisms to involve stakeholders from different disciplines asynchronously, with feedback cycles for review.
* Searchable Knowledge Base: A well-organized collection of decisions made for reference and onboarding new team members.

By choosing DeciCollab, you're reinforcing an ecosystem of collective ownership of decisions that scale as the project evolves, with everyone on the same page—across departments, teams, and even geographies.

## ADR and TDR InnerSource Common Patterns:

* __Documentation of Decisions__: Use Architecture Decision Records (ADR) and Technical Debt Records (TDR) to document decisions and trade-offs made across teams.
* __Collaborative Input__: Encourage cross-team contributions, with discussions around decisions to ensure diverse perspectives are considered.
* __Transparent Process__: Maintain clear, open documentation that allows anyone in the organization to review, understand, and participate in ongoing decisions.
* __Iteration and Updates__: Continuously refine decisions as the project evolves, using feedback loops and keeping all documentation up-to-date.
* __Decentralized Ownership__: Support shared ownership of decisions, ensuring teams contribute to and benefit from each other’s insights and expertise.


My first formulation of pattern:

* [Innersource Patterns](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org)
* [Pattern Template](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/appendix/pattern-template)
* [Request of comment ADR/TDR Innnersource pattern](./Document-Architecture-Decisions-Pattern.md)

A really good RFC collaborations pattern still exists:

* [Transparent Cross-Team Decision Making using RFCs](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/2-structured/transparent-cross-team-decision-making-using-rfcs.md)
  * Is ADR and TDRs practical tools or a relevant separate pattern?
