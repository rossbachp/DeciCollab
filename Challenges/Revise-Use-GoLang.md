# Plan for Adopting Go (Golang)

## Context

Assess and plan the adoption of Go in your team, project, or organization with clarity and alignment.

## Steps

* Define an Architecture Decision Record (ADR):
  * Document the rationale, strategy, and implications for transitioning to Go as your primary programming language.
* State the Reasons for the Change:
  * Identify and clearly articulate why Go is a suitable choice for your needs. Consider factors such as:
  * Enhanced reuse of existing frameworks (prioritize “buy over build”).
  * Focus on building User Interfaces (UIs) efficiently.
  * Specialization needs like leveraging Rust for better performance in embedded systems or kernel driver development.
  * Demand for creating and scaling RESTful APIs with better developer productivity.
* Discuss the Consequences:
  * Evaluate the potential outcomes and challenges
  * Team Composition: Identify team members who might leave or resist the change and plan to onboard new developers familiar with Go.
  * Scalability: Understand the resources and time needed to scale development with Go.
  * Cost Analysis: Assess migration costs, including time, resources, and possible downtime during the transition.
