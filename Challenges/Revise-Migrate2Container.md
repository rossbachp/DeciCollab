# Plan for Migrating to a Container Orchestration Platform

## Define an Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

Create a detailed ADR to outline the migration strategy for moving your applications to Kubernetes.

## Identify the Key Drivers for Migration

Clearly articulate the reasons for adopting Kubernetes as your platform. Examples might include:

* Industry Adoption: Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration.
* Scalability: The ability to scale your applications globally to handle varying workloads.
* Rapid Feature Delivery: Support for frequent updates and changes to application features.
* Leveraging Reusable Services: Easily integrate and consume pre-built, reusable cloud-native services to accelerate * development.

## Determine Deployment Strategy

Decide on the hosting model that fits your requirements:

* Cloud-Based: Take advantage of managed Kubernetes services like GKE, EKS, or AKS for ease of use and reduced operational overhead.
* On-Premises: Retain control and meet compliance or latency needs with platforms like OpenShift or self-managed Kubernetes clusters.
