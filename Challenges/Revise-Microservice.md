# Evaluating and Revising Microservice Architecture

## Define an Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

Clearly document the decision-making process for revisiting your microservices strategy and the reasons for potential changes.

## Identify the Rationale for Change

Articulate the reasons for modifying or abandoning the existing microservices architecture, such as:

* Reverting to a Monolith:
  * Consolidate services back into a modular monolith to simplify development and maintenance.
* Adopting Serverless:
  * Transition to a serverless architecture to optimize resource utilization and event-driven workloads.
* Complexity Issues:
  * The architecture has become overly complex, making it difficult to manage, maintain, or implement changes efficiently.
* Scalability Challenges:
  * The current architecture is not meeting scalability requirements, negating the expected benefits of microservices.
