# Revising Logging Strategy

## Define an Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

Create a comprehensive ADR to document the rationale and approach for revising your logging framework and strategy.

## Outline the Key Reasons for Change

Clearly articulate why the current logging framework needs to be updated, considering factors such as:

* Adoption of Structured Logging:
  * Enhance log readability and processing by enforcing structured log formats.
* Framework Transition:
  * Migrate from Log4J to Logback for better performance, features, or security considerations.
* Shift to Tracing:
  * Upgrade to a distributed tracing approach for improved observability across microservices and systems.
* Context Enrichment:
  * Standardize inclusion of contextual metadata in logs, such as UUIDs, error codes, system IDs, and flow IDs, to aid debugging and monitoring.
* Multi-Language Support:
  * Ensure logging consistency and compatibility across applications written in different programming languages.
