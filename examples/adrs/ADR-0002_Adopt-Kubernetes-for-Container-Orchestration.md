## Status

[Drafted | __Proposed__ | Accepted | Rejected | Deprecated | Superseded | Implemented]

## Context

As our organization moves towards a cloud-native architecture, there is a need for a scalable, flexible, and reliable platform to manage containerized workloads. Several platforms exist, but Kubernetes stands out as a potential solution.

## Decision

Adopt Kubernetes as the container orchestration platform for the organization's application and service deployments.

### Reasons for the Decision

#### Industry Adoption

Kubernetes is the de facto standard for container orchestration. Its widespread adoption across industries ensures robust community support, a large ecosystem of tools, and the availability of skilled professionals.

#### Scalability

Kubernetes offers features such as horizontal pod autoscaling and cluster autoscaling that make it capable of scaling globally to handle varying and unpredictable workloads.

#### Rapid Feature Delivery

Kubernetesâ€™ declarative configuration and built-in features like rolling updates and canary deployments support continuous integration and delivery pipelines, enabling rapid deployment of updates and features.

#### Leveraging Reusable Services

Kubernetes allows seamless integration with pre-built, reusable cloud-native services such as monitoring (e.g., Prometheus), logging (e.g., Fluentd), and service meshes (e.g., Istio). These capabilities accelerate development by reducing the need to build custom solutions.

#### Portability and Flexibility

Kubernetes enables multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud strategies, reducing vendor lock-in and increasing resilience by deploying workloads across different cloud providers or on-premises infrastructures.

#### Rich Ecosystem

The Kubernetes ecosystem, including Helm charts, Operators, and CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions), provides a wide variety of solutions for diverse application requirements, simplifying both development and operations.

## Consequences

### Complexity of Setup and Operations

Kubernetes introduces operational complexity, including cluster maintenance, networking configuration, and security. The organization must invest in training and documentation to ensure operational success.

### Initial Learning Curve

There will be an initial investment in upskilling the development and DevOps teams to effectively work with Kubernetes and its ecosystem.

### Additional Infrastructure Overhead

Kubernetes clusters can introduce overhead costs in terms of infrastructure usage, which must be carefully optimized as part of operational planning.

## Alternatives Considered

* Docker Swarm:
  * Simplistic but limited scalability and weaker community support.
* Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service):
  * Easier integration with AWS but less flexibility in multi-cloud/hybrid-cloud deployments.
* Nomad:
  * Lightweight and simpler than Kubernetes but lacks a comparably extensive ecosystem.
* Basecamp Kamal:
  * Kamal basically is Capistrano for Containers, without the  need to carefully prepare servers in advance.

## Follow-Up Actions

* Team Enablement:
  * Organize Kubernetes training sessions and hands-on labs.
* Infrastructure Setup:
  * Provision Kubernetes clusters in the desired environment (cloud, on-premises, hybrid).
* Evaluate Tools:
  * Identify and integrate essential tools (e.g., Helm, Prometheus, Istio) for observability and workflow management.
* Establish Best Practices:
  * Develop internal documentation and guidelines to manage complexity effectively.
